couchapp](/web/20140209091220/http://couchapp.org/page/backbone)

Backbone.js is minimalist mvc framework for JavaScript, written by Jeremy
ashkenas, the author of coffee script. Backbone is a good choice for creating
larger couch apps, as an alternative to evently. A robust backbone-couchdb
connector that supports realtime updates via the _changes feed is supported by
Jan Monschke.
