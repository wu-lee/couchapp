# Using backbone.js with couchapp

Backbone.js is minimalist mvc framework for JavaScript, written by Jeremy
ashkenas, the author of coffee script. Backbone is a good choice for creating
larger couch apps, as an alternative to evently. A robust backbone-couchdb
connector that supports realtime updates via the _changes feed is supported by
Jan Monschke.

See this [introduction](http://janmonschke.posterous.com/backbone-couchdb-give-your-couchapp-some-back) to couch apps with backbone by
Jan.

Extended version of Backbone.js couch connector (with fixing some issues,
extending functionality) is available here:
