# **[CouchApp.org](index.md):**
[couchapp (python)](couchapp-.md
python)

The [couchapp](couchapp-python.md)
command line tool is written in Python and used to generate code templates in
your application and to push your changes to an instance of couchdb, among
other things. Here is how to get started with the CouchApp command line tool:

  * [Installing couchapp](installing.md)
  * [Couchapp configuration](couchapp-config.md)
  * [The couchapp command line tool](couchapp-usage.md)
  * [Extending the couchapp command line tool](couchapp-extend.md)
  * [Using couchapp with multiple design documents](multiple-design-docs.md)
  * [The Filesystem Mapping](filesystem-mapping.md)

There can be confusion with the term 'CouchApp' because it can refer to this
tool, named 'CouchApp', or a general application served from CouchDB. This is
probably due to the fact that the CouchApp command line tool was the first
full way of developing a CouchApp.

### The Generated Application

After creating a new couchapp, you will have a project structure that looks
something like [this template
project](/web/20140209100158/https://github.com/jchris/proto). The following
libraries are included with your new couchapp by default:

#### [Evently](evently.md)

A declarative, couchdb friendly JQuery library for writing Javascript
applications

#### CouchDB API ([jquery.couch.js](/web/20140209100158/http://github.com/apac
he/couchdb/blob/trunk/share/www/script/jquery.couch.js))

The JQuery library included with CouchDB itself for use by the Futon admin
console is used to interact with couchdb. Some [limited
documentation](/web/20140209100158/http://www.couch.io/page/library-jquery-
couch-js-database) is available from Couchone.

#### CouchApp Loader ([jquery.couch.app.js](/web/20140209100158/https://github
.com/couchapp/couchapp/blob/master/couchapp/templates/vendor/_attachments/jque
ry.couch.app.js))

A utility for loading design document classes into your Javascript application

#### Pathbinder ([jquery.pathbinder.js](/web/20140209100158/http://couchapp.co
uchone.com/docs/_design/docs/index.html#/topic/pathbinder))

A tiny framework for triggering events based on paths in URL hash.

#### [Mustache](/web/20140209100158/https://github.com/janl/mustache.js)

A simple template framework
