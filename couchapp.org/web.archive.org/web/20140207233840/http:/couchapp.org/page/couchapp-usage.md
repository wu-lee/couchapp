## Commands

### generate

Generates a basic CouchApp, also used to create function templates (ie. view,
list, show, filter, etc.).

    
    
        couchapp generate myapp
        cd myapp
        couchapp generate view someview
    

### init

Initialize a CouchApp. Run this command in your application's folder to create
two JSON encoded configuration files, `.couchapprc` for server configuration
and `.couchappignore` for a blacklist of files that will not be uploaded. This
command can be used to initialize a cloned application from external
repository (git, hg).

    
    
        cd mycouchapp
        couchapp init
    

### push

Push a CouchApp to one or more
[CouchDB](/web/20140209090820/http://couchdb.apache.org/) servers

    
    
        cd mycouchapp
        couchapp push http://someserver:port/mydb
    

  * `\--no-atomic` sends attachments one by one. By default, all attachments are sent inline.
  * `\--export` only outputs JSON to `stdout`. Use in conjunction with `\--output` to save to a file.
  * `\--force` force attachment sending
  * `\--docid` sets a custom document id for this CouchApp. (ie. `_design/someid`)

### pushapps

Sends a folder of multiple CouchApps at once, similar to
[push](push.md).

    
    
        couchapp pushapps somedir/
    

### pushdocs

Sends a folder of JSON documents, used to populate your CouchDB database,
similar to (push apps)[pushapps] but for documents only. Alternatively, you
may create a top-level `_docs` folder.

### browse

Browse your CouchApp in the browser.

To browse with "official" CouchDBs

    
    
         couchapp browse . http://host:port/mydb
         or 
         couchapp browse . mydb (for default url) 
    

For desktopcouch on Ubuntu

    
    
         couchapp browse . desktopcouch://mydb
