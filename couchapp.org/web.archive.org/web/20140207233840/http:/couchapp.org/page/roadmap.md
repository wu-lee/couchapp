# **[CouchApp.org](index.md):**
[CouchApp Roadmap](roadmap.md)

## Developer Toolchain

### Python `couchapp push` script

  * upload only changed attachments (md5 on attachment stubs?)

### Node.js CouchApp Tools

  * try Mikeal's Node.js CouchApp style

## JavaScript Libraries

### $.couch.app()

  * Make this responsible only for loading code from the Couch, and bootstrapping the CommonJS runtime.
  * make $.couch.app.utils a commonjs library.
  * move into Apache CouchDB's `share/www/script`

### Evently

  * make it a CommonJS lib.
  * more docs
  * try non-filesystem style for somethings
  * make modules more reuseable
